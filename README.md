# QueryR Application

The primary purpose of this project is to re-create another verison of the QueryR application, which I presented at CSTE 2024. Since there was interest in the underlying code, I decided to add this project to my Github portfolio. 

This application provides a basic, point-and-click user interface to allow individuals to query a database using a set of defined inputs and extract only necessary data without requiring user knowledge of R or SQL. 

The underlying data being queried by this application is completely fake, but is structured to mimic patient data and disease investigation data that is often worked with by Data Scientists in Public Health. 

Note: The application itself cannot be hosted without me hosting a cloud-based version of Postgres or releasing my personal IP address. The code to deploy the application is available here and if you'd like to see a demonstration of the application itself, please feel free to reach out to me at jessaus1305@gmail.com!
